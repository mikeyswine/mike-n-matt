Hey Miguel!

  Just a quick sketch of a grid move system I just invented.  I did it in 4.4, so you'll have to DL that prolly to run it.

  I used easing to make it feel more tasty.  I was gonna confine the movement to a move state (tweens have a finished signal you could connect with code to detect the end of the move,) but if you spam the move keys, it has a super fun wiggly motion, so I left it!  You can tweak the move_time export var to see the easing of the tween more dramatically.  Take a quick look at the documentation, especially their links to examples of different kinds of tweens.  There's an animated example webpage to give you an idea.
